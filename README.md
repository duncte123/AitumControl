# Aitum Control
Controlling Aitum via an app because I don't want to pay Elgato for a subscription

# How do I run this myself?
The app is on the playstore: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.duncte123.aitumcontrol](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.duncte123.aitumcontrol)

Alternatively, you can download the APK from the releases, just don't blame me if it breaks for you.

# Is this jank?
Partially.
